-o (Trond:) Yes: I'm still working on an atomic "open()", i.e.  one
-           where we short-circuit the usual VFS path_walk() + lookup() +
-           permission() + create() + ....  bullsh*t...
-
-           I have several reasons for wanting to do this (all of
-           them related to NFS of course, but much of the reasoning applies
-           to *all* networked file systems).
-
-   1) The above sequence is simply not atomic on *any* networked
-      filesystem.
-
-   2) It introduces a sh*tload of completely unnecessary RPC calls (why
-      do a 'permission' RPC call when the server is in *any* case going to
-      tell you whether or not this operations is allowed.  Why do a
-      'lookup()' when the 'create()' call can be made to tell you whether or
-      not a file already exists).
-
-   3) It is incompatible with some operations: the current create()
-      doesn't pass an 'EXCLUSIVE' flag down to the filesystems.
-
-   4) (NFS specific?) open() has very different cache consistency
-      requirements when compared to most other VFS operations.
-
-   I'd very much like for something like Peter Braam's 'lookup with
-   intent' or (better yet) for a proper dentry->open() to be integrated with
-   path_walk()/open_namei().  I'm still working on the latter (Peter has
-   already completed the lookup with intent stuff).
