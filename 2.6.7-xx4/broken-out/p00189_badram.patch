+INFORMATION ON USING BAD RAM MODULES
+====================================
+
+Introduction
+	RAM is getting smaller and smaller, and as a result, also more and more
+	vulnerable. This makes the manufacturing of hardware more expensive,
+	since an excessive amount of RAM chips must be discarded on account of
+	a single cell that is wrong. Similarly, static discharge may damage a
+	RAM module forever, which is usually remedied by replacing it
+	entirely.
+
+	This is not necessary, as the BadRAM code shows: By informing the Linux
+	kernel which addresses in a RAM are damaged, the kernel simply avoids
+	ever allocating such addresses but makes all the rest available.
+
+Reasons for this feature
+	There are many reasons why this kernel feature is useful:
+	- Chip manufacture is resource intensive; waste less and sleep better
+	- It's another chance to promote Linux as "the flexible OS"
+	- Some laptops have their RAM soldered in... and then it fails!
+	- It's plain cool ;-)
+
+Running example
+	To run this project, I was given two DIMMs, 32 MB each. One, that we
+	shall use as a running example in this text, contained 512 faulty bits,
+	spread over 1/4 of the address range in a regular pattern. Some tricks
+	with a RAM tester and a few binary calculations were sufficient to
+	write these faults down in 2 longword numbers.
+
+	The kernel recognised the correct number of pages with faults and did
+	not give them out for allocation. The allocation routines could
+	therefore progress as normally, without any adaption.
+	So, I gained 30 MB of DIMM which would otherwise have been thrown
+	away. After booting the kernel, the kernel behaved exactly as it
+	always had.
+
+Initial checks
+	If you experience RAM trouble, first read /usr/src/linux/memory.txt
+	and try out the mem=4M trick to see if at least some initial parts
+	of your RAM work well. The BadRAM routines halt the kernel in panic
+	if the reserved area of memory (containing kernel stuff) contains
+	a faulty address.
+
+Running a RAM checker
+	The memory checker is not built into the kernel, to avoid delays at
+	runtime. If you experience problems that may be caused by RAM, run
+	a good RAM checker, such as
+		http://reality.sgi.com/cbrady_denver/memtest86
+	The output of a RAM checker provides addresses that went wrong. In
+	the 32 MB chip with 512 faulty bits mentioned above, the errors were
+	found in the 8MB-16MB range (the DIMM was in slot #0) at addresses
+		xxx42f4
+		xxx62f4
+		xxxc2f4
+		xxxe2f4
+	and the error was a "sticky 1 bit", a memory bit that stayed "1" no
+	matter what was written to it. The regularity of this pattern
+	suggests the death of a buffer at the output stages of a row on one of
+	the chips. I expect such regularity to be commonplace. Finding this
+	regularity currently is human effort, but it should not be hard to
+	alter a RAM checker to capture it in some sort of pattern, possibly
+	the BadRAM patterns described below.
+
+	By the way, if you manage to get hold of memtest86 version 2.3 or
+	beyond, you can configure the printing mode to produce BadRAM patterns,
+	which find out exactly what you must enter on the LILO: commandline,
+	except that you shouldn't mention the added spacing. That means that
+	you can skip the following step, which saves you a *lot* of work.
+
+	Also by the way, if your machine has the ISA memory gap in the 15M-16M
+	range unstoppable, Linux can get in trouble. One way of handling that
+	situation is by specifying the total memory size to Linux with a boot
+	parameter mem=... and then to tell it to treat the 15M-16M range as
+	faulty with an additional boot parameter, for instance:
+		mem=24M badram=0x00f00000,0xfff00000
+	if you installed 24MB of RAM in total.
+
+Capturing errors in a pattern
+	Instead of manually providing all 512 errors to the kernel, it's nicer
+	to generate a pattern. Since the regularity is based on address decoding
+	software, which generally takes certain bits into account and ignores
+	others, we shall provide a faulty address F, together with a bit mask M
+	that specifies which bits must be equal to F. In C code, an address A
+	is faulty if and only if
+		(F & M) == (A & M)
+	or alternately (closer to a hardware implementation):
+		~((F ^ A) & M)
+	In the example 32 MB chip, we had the faulty addresses in 8MB-16MB:
+		xxx42f4		....0100....
+		xxx62f4		....0110....
+		xxxc2f4		....1100....
+		xxxe2f4		....1110....
+	The second column represents the alternating hex digit in binary form.
+	Apperantly, the first and one-but last binary digit can be anything,
+	so the binary mask for that part is 0101. The mask for the part after
+	this is 0xfff, and the part before should select anything in the range
+	8MB-16MB, or 0x00800000-0x01000000; this is done with a bitmask
+	0xff80xxxx. Combining these partial masks, we get:
+		F=0x008042f4    M=0xff805fff
+	That covers everything for this DIMM; for more complicated failing
+	DIMMs, or for a combination of multiple failing DIMMs, it can be
+	necessary to set up a number of such F/M pairs.
+
+Rebooting Linux
+	Now that these patterns are known (and double-checked, the calculations
+	are highly error-prone... it would be neat to test them in the RAM
+	checker...) we simply restart Linux with these F/M pairs as a parameter.
+	If you normally boot as follows:
+	       LILO: linux
+	you should now boot with
+	       LILO: linux badram=0x008042f4,0xff805fff
+	or perhaps by mentioning more F/M pairs in an order F0,M0,F1,M1,...
+	When you provide an odd number of arguments to badram, the default mask
+	0xffffffff (only one address matched) is applied to the pattern.
+
+	Beware of the commandline length. At least up to LILO version 0.21,
+	the commandline is cut off after the 78th character; later versions
+	may go as far as the kernel goes, namely 255 characters. In no way is
+	it possible to enter more than 10 numbers to the badram boot option.
+
+	When the kernel now boots, it should not give any trouble with RAM.
+	Mind you, this is under the assumption that the kernel and its data
+	storage do not overlap an erroneous part. If this happens, and the
+	kernel does not choke on it right away, it will stop with a panic.
+	You will need to provide a RAM where the initial, say 2MB, is faultless.
+
+	Now look up your memory status with
+	       dmesg | grep ^Memory:
+	which prints a single line with information like
+		Memory: 158524k/163840k available
+			(940k kernel code,
+			412k reserved,
+			1856k data,
+			60k init,
+			0k highmem,
+			2048k BadRAM)
+	The latter entry, the badram, is 2048k to represent the loss of 2MB
+	of general purpose RAM due to the errors. Or, positively rephrased,
+	instead of throwing out 32MB as useless, you only throw out 2MB.
+
+	If the system is stable (try compiling a few kernels, and do a few
+	finds in / or so) you may add the boot parameter to /etc/lilo.conf
+	as a line to _all_ the kernels that handle this trouble with a line
+		append="badram=0x008042f4,0xff805fff"
+	after which you run "lilo".
+	Warning: Don't experiment with these settings on your only boot image.
+	If the BadRAM overlays kernel code, data, init, or other reserved
+	memory, the kernel will halt in panic. Try settings on a test boot
+	image first, and if you get a panic you should change the order of
+	your DIMMs [which may involve buying a new one just to be able to
+	change the order].
+
+	You are allowed to enter any number of BadRAM patterns in all the
+	places documented in this file. They will all apply. It is even
+	possible to mention several BadRAM patterns in a single place. The
+	completion of an odd number of arguments with the default mask is
+	done separately for each badram=... option.
+
+Kernel Customisation
+	Some people prefer to enter their badram patterns in the kernel, and
+	this is also possible. In mm/page_alloc.c there is an array of unsigned
+	long integers into which the parameters can be entered, prefixed with
+	the number of integers (twice the number of patterns). The array is
+	named badram_custom and it will be added to the BadRAM list whenever an
+	option 'badram' is provided on the commandline when booting, either
+	with or without additional patterns.
+
+	For the previous example, the code would become
+
+	static unsigned long __initdata badram_custom[] = {
+		2,	// Number of longwords that follow, as F/M pairs
+		0x008042f4L, 0xff805fffL,
+	};
+
+	Even on this place you may assume the default mask to be filled in
+	when you enter an odd number of longwords. Specify the number of
+	longwords to be 0 to avoid influence of this custom BadRAM list.
+
+BadRAM classification
+	This technique may start a lively market for "dead" RAM. It is important
+	to realise that some RAMs are more dead than others. So, instead of
+	just providing a RAM size, it is also important to know the BadRAM
+	class, which is defined as follows:
+
+		A BadRAM class N means that at most 2^N bytes have a problem,
+		and that all problems with the RAMs are persistent: They
+		are predictable and always show up.
+
+	The DIMM that serves as an example here was of class 9, since 512=2^9
+	errors were found. Higher classes are worse, "correct" RAM is of class
+	-1 (or even less, at your choice).
+	Class N also means that the bitmask for your chip (if there's just one,
+	that is) counts N bits "0" and it means that (if no faults fall in the
+	same page) an amount of 2^N*PAGESIZE memory is lost, in the example on
+	an i386 architecture that would be 2^9*4k=2MB, which accounts for the
+	initial claim of 30MB RAM gained with this DIMM.
+
+	Note that this scheme has deliberately been defined to be independent
+	of memory technology and of computer architecture.
+
+Known Bugs
+	LILO is known to cut off commandlines which are too long. For the
+	lilo-0.21 distribution, a commandline may not exceed 78 characters,
+	while actually, 255 would be possible [on i386, kernel 2.2.16].
+	LILO does _not_ report too-long commandlines, but the error will
+	show up as either a panic at boot time, stating
+		panic: BadRAM page in initial area
+	or the dmesg line starting with Memory: will mention an unpredicted
+	number of kilobytes. (Note that the latter number only includes
+	errors in accessed memory.)
+
+Future Possibilities
+	It would be possible to use even more of the faulty RAMs by employing
+	them for slabs. The smaller allocation granularity of slabs makes it
+	possible to throw out just, say, 32 bytes surrounding an error. This
+	would mean that the example DIMM only looses 16kB instead of 2MB.
+	It might even be possible to allocate the slabs in such a way that,
+	where possible, the remaining bytes in a slab structure are allocated
+	around the error, reducing the RAM loss to 0 in the optimal situation!
+
+	However, this yield is somewhat faked: It is possible to provide 512
+	pages of 32-byte slabs, but it is not certain that anyone would use
+	that many 32-byte slabs at any time.
+
+	A better solution might be to alter the page allocation for a slab to
+	have a preference for BadRAM pages, and given those a special treatment.
+	This way, the BadRAM would be spread over all the slabs, which seems
+	more likely to be a `true' pay-off. This would yield more overhead at
+	slab allocation time, but on the other hand, by the nature of slabs,
+	such allocations are made as rare as possible, so it might not matter
+	that much. I am uncertain where to go.
+
+	Many suggestions have been made to insert a RAM checker at boot time;
+	since this would leave the time to do only very meager checking, it
+	is not a reasonable option; we already have a BIOS doing that in most
+	systems!
+
+	It would be interesting to integrate this functionality with the
+	self-verifying nature of ECC RAM. These memories can even distinguish
+	between recorable and unrecoverable errors! Such memory has been
+	handled in older operating systems by `testing' once-failed memory
+	blocks for a while, by placing only (reloadable) program code in it.
+	Unfortunately, I possess no faulty ECC modules to work this out.

+	this patch (with debugging and a few other fancy things).

+	the test reportings on that site, I hope you will mail me with that
